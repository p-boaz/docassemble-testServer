question: |
  Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)
subquestion: |
  Generally Accepted Privacy Principles has been developed from a business perspective, referencing some but by no means all significant local, national and international privacy regulations. GAPP converts complex privacy requirements into a single privacy objective supported by 10 privacy principles. Each principle is supported by objective, measurable criteria (73 in all) that form the basis for effective management of privacy risk and compliance. Illustrative policy requirements, communications and controls, including their monitoring, are provided as support for the criteria.

  GAPP can be used by any organization as part of its privacy program. GAPP has been developed to help management create an effective privacy program that addresses privacy risks and obligations as well as business opportunities. It can also be a useful tool to boards and others charged with governance and the provision of oversight. It includes a definition of privacy and an explanation of why privacy is a business issue and not solely a compliance issue. Also illustrated are how these principles can be applied to outsourcing arrangements and the types of privacy initiatives that can be undertaken for the benefit of organizations, their customers and related persons.
