question: |
  Name and contact details of joint controller
subquestion: |
  If your company is deciding the purpose for the collection of personally identifiable information, you are classified by GDPR as the ‘controller’.
  
  If your company is processing data on behalf of another organization then you are classified as the ‘processor’.
  
  It is most likely that your company acts as both controller and processor, but you may use other third-party processors too.
  
  The best approach for the purposes of compliance is to record the contact details of your Data Protection Officer within your company. This person will be the go to point of contact for the data that is being recorded in your data map and there may be multiple or joint controllers across your organization who are responsible for different data categories.
