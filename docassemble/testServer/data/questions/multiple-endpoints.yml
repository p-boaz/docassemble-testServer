  Demo: How to handle a Data Subject Rights Request (DSRR)
subquestion: |
  One of the key objectives of the new European General Data
  Protection Regulation (GDPR) is to ensure the privacy and
  protection of the personal data of data subjects. To help data
  subjects in being assured of the protection and privacy of their
  personal data, GDPR empowers data subjects with certain rights. 
  
  Through these rights, data subjects can make a specific request
  and be assured that personal data is not being misused for 
  anything other than the legitimate purpose for which it was
  originally provided. Let us understand the different GDPR data
  subject rights and requests that a data subject can make as a
  customer, as an employee, and as personnel of a supplier.
