subquestion: |
  We'll cut right to the chase by laying out a few scenarios to determine where you and your company currently stand. 
  
  ###The [beginner] track
  
  * "We're not sure if we need to comply with {GDPR}." 
  
  ###The [learner] track 
  
  * "We know we need to comply with GDPR but we don't know the requirements and we haven't built up a {data protection/privacy program} yet." 
  
  ###The [builder] track
  
  * "We've taken some steps to comply with GDPR but we still need a lot of help."
  
  ###The [perfecter] track 
  
  * "Our privacy program is fairly mature but we are interested in becoming top notch."
