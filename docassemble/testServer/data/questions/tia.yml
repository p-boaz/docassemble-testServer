mandatory: True
section: two
question: |
  Section 2: Consider the adequacy of the legal regime in the
  destination country
subquestion: |
  At this stage, the methodology will assess if there is anything in the law or practice of **${ importing_country.name }** that may impinge on the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards of the transfer tools you are relying on, in the context of your specific transfer.
  
  We will also assess whether those protections are essentially equivalent to those offered within the EU and consistent with the restrictions set out in the GDPR and guarantees provided for in the relevant transfer terms (SCCs).
  
  This assessment will follow the principles set out in Article
  45(2) GDPR (the test for adequacy of a third country) and include
  consideration of the following key factors as applicable to the
  specific transfer 
  
  * the nature and type of data being transferred
  * sectors in which the recipient operates as there may be sector
  specific variances to this component
field: intro_to_two

mandatory: true
section: data_privacy
question: |
  2.1 Regulation of data privacy
subquestion: |
  Here, we look at the extent to which local data privacy laws offer legal safeguards to the data processing of personal data equivalent to the protections offered in the EU. This includes an analysis of the local privacy and data protection law framework, including constitutional rights to privacy and how those laws apply both to the data importer but also third parties (e.g. law enforcement) who may seek to secure access to the data following transfer.
  
  In this context, note the EU / UK has a developed law that specifically recognises legal rights to protection of “personal data” consistent with the principles of data protection set out in OECD Convention 108+.

  % if importing_country.level_of_protection == 'Member country of the EU or the EEA':
  ${ importing_country } belongs to the European Economic Area.
  
  % elif importing_country.level_of_protection == 'Adequate country':
  ${ importing_country } ensures an adequate level of data protection recognized by EU. Data transfers to **${ importing_country }** do not require the use of transfer tools.

  % elif importing_country.level_of_protection == 'Country partially adequate':
  **${ importing_country }** is partially recognized as ensuring an adequate level of data protection by EU for certain specific processing. 

  % elif importing_country.level_of_protection == 'Independent authority and law (s)':
  **${ importing_country }** doesn't ensure an adequate level of data protection recognized by EU.
  
  * Data transfers to **${ importing_country }** require the use of transfer tools. 
  * **${ importing_country }** has a data protection law and an independant data protection authority accredited at the international conference of data protection and privacy commissionners.

  % elif importing_country.level_of_protection == 'With legislation':
  **${ importing_country }** has general legislation on personal data protection or specific provisions, but it doesn't ensure an adequate level of data protection recognized by EU. Data transfers to **${ importing_country }** require the use of transfer tools.

  % elif importing_country.level_of_protection == 'No law':
  **${ importing_country }** doesn't have a data protection law. Therefore, it doesn't ensure an adequate level of data protection recognized by EU. Data transfers to **${ importing_country }** require the use of transfer tools.

mandatory: True
section: pub_auth
question: |
  2.2 Regulation of public authority access to private data
subquestion: |
  The extent to which the level of access legally permitted and / or actually conducted by public authorities to personal data (e.g. to secure disclosure of, or conduct surveillance on, private information for national security purposes or other reasons) is subject to safeguards equivalent to that within the EU. This will consider specifically whether the right of public authorities to access data is:
  
  1. underpinned by a clear legal basis (conducted ‘in accordance with law’),
  2. carried out in pursuit of legitimate aims which are necessary in a democratic society (‘proportionate’) and
  3. subject to adequate judicial oversight
  
  The assessment will consider both pervasive surveillance activity (across the destination country as a whole) and as may be specifically relevant to the circumstances of this transfer identified in Step 1 (i.e. rules that only apply to certain types of data or categories of data importer - e.g. sectoral laws applicable to a cloud-based vendor).
field: pub_auth_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: reg_sup
question: |
  2.3 Regulatory supervision
subquestion: |
  The extent to which courts, regulators and/or supervisory authorities enforce the rule of law and/or rights guaranteed in relation to the protection of data in an independent and effective manner, with evidence of meaningful resources and enforcement activity
field: reg_sup_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: redress
question: |
  2.4 Rights of redress
subquestion: |
  The extent to which individuals can easily and effectively enforce rights and seek redress by raising complaints, claims and / or appeal and enforce decisions in relation to both data protection infringements and public disclosure / surveillance activity through judicial and/or administrative processes (eg help from local data protection authorities) that support each of access to protect personal rights. This section will also consider whether data subjects can secure self help remedies e.g. right to secure access to or require erasure of personal data files.
field: redress_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: treaties
question: |
  2.5 International treaties
subquestion: |
  The extent to which the country has concluded international treaties and related commitments on handling personal data to support the safeguarding of data this will include consideration both of the existence of: 
  
  1. international treaties that relate to the protection of data generally consistent with principles enshrined in EU law, and
  2. any specific arrangements concluded to provide safeguards in relation to country to country transfers (e.g. UK-U.S. Bilateral Data Access Agreement which brings into effect the 'quashing' provisions of 18 USC § 2703(h)(2))
field: treaties_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: three
question: |
  Section 3: Consider supplemental measures that may available to
  safeguard the data
subquestion: |
  At this stage we will assess any protections adopted by the
  parties or otherwise relevant to the circumstances in which the
  transfer is made which may provide additional safeguards to the
  personal data / mitigate the risks posed in Step 2. This stage
  will consider three criteria:
field: intro_to_three
---
mandatory: true
section: contractual
question: |
  3.1 Contractual
subquestion: |
  Whether the parties have agreed additional contractual commitments which enhance (or in any way undermine) the guarantees offered in the SCCs and/or mitigate the risk posed by shortfalls within the destination country legal regime examples may include:
  
   1. a process to be applied when there is a subpoena / legal process requiring the importer to challenge or demand individual review of an order to extent possible;
   2. an obligation to inform the exporter of the subpoena / legal process in a manner whereby the exporter can suspend the transfer / withdraw the data before a disclosure is made (to the extent not prohibited by an anti- tipping off law);
   3. an obligation to routinely report to the exporter that there have been no disclosure requests made by authorities in the preceding period (‘warrant canary’);
   4. requiring or requesting the requesting authority – to the extent permissible by law – to use an MLAT process; similarly where there are unhelpful contractual provisions, this would have a negative effect on the score
field: contractual_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: self_or_co
question: |
  3.2 Self/co-regulatory
subquestion: |
  Whether the importer is committed to adhering to any self-regulatory or voluntary schemes which provide additional protective measures for data subjects – examples may include (i) sector specific professional codes of conduct, or (ii) continuing commitments to schemes such as the Privacy Shield framework even after the Schrems II judgement – as referenced on the Department of Commerce website, this may still be a relevant factor in reducing privacy risk, although not determinative.
field: self_or_co_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: measures
question: |
  3.3 Technical, organisational or policy / process measures
subquestion: |
  The extent to which privacy enhancing controls have been adopted by the parties to mitigate risk, for example by seeking to anonymise or pseudonymise the personal data (e.g. where the sole means of re-identification are held outside the destination country and outside the reach of the laws of the destination country), and / or otherwise preventing the importer from being able to disclose the personal data, such as encryption keys being kept in another jurisdiction (bearing in mind that any form of root / admin access that may circumvent such measures / controls would likely render this variable as ineffective in terms of mitigation); similarly where the measures act to facilitate disclosure (e.g. a policy to disclose without a court order, a policy to permit unfettered access to stored data, etc.) this would have a negative effect on the score
field: measures_assessment
---
mandatory: True
section: four
question: |
  Section 4: Consider the risk of harm to which a data subject may
  be exposed
subquestion: |
  At this stage we will consider the potential risk of harm that
  may be caused to a data subject as a consequence of their data
  being transferred to a third country, taking account of any
  shortfall in the safeguards guaranteed in the EU / UK as
  identified in Steps 2 and 3 and other real-life variables. This
  element of the assessment is important to help understand the
  relative importance of the protections in the context of the
  particularities of the data transfer and whether (in practice)
  there is a meaningful undermining of the safeguards provided to
  the data subject in the EEA / UK.
  
  This part of the assessment will consider two factors:
field: intro_to_four
---
mandatory: true
section: severity
question: |
  4.1 Severity of harm
subquestion: |
  The potential severity of harm that could occur to the data subject as a result of the identified shortfalls, including the likely distress an individual might suffer due to the loss of privacy in the data, possible sanctions faced as a result of processing, such as capital or corporal punishment, length and severity of custodial sentence, size of financial penalty, imposition of financial sanctions, etc, with a score assigned depending on the perceived severity of the risks.
  
field: severity_assessment
---
mandatory: true
section: likelihood
question: |
  4.2 Likelihood of harm
subquestion: |
  The likelihood / probability of harm arising to the data subject, given the circumstances in which the transfer is made. This will take into consideration relevant factors identified in Step 1, such as the nature of the data / data subject and its interest to law enforcement / security establishment; the likelihood that law enforcement / security establishment would request the personal data from the importer or a processor / sub-processor rather than from the exporter directly; and whether the importer will (to the extent the law permits it) exercise any rights it has to challenge the request.

  adequacy decision: |
    At any time, the European Parliament and the Council may request the European Commission to maintain, amend or withdraw the adequacy decision on the grounds that its act exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the regulation.
    The effect of such a decision is that personal data can flow from the EU (and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to that third country without any further safeguard being necessary. In others words, transfers to the country in question will be assimilated to intra-EU transmissions of data.
