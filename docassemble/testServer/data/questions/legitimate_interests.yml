question: |
  The ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office), the UK’s data protection authority, suggests using a three-part test.
subquestion: |
  The first part is the purpose test, which helps you decide whether the processing can be considered a legitimate interest. It’s comprised of the following questions:

  * Why do you want to process the data? What are you trying to achieve?
  * Who benefits from the processing? In what way?
  * Are there any wider public benefits to the processing?
  * If so, how significant are those benefits?
  * What would the impact be if you couldn’t process this information?
  * Would your use of the data be unethical or unlawful in any way?

  The second part is the necessity test, which helps you decide whether legitimate interest is the most appropriate lawful basis. It’s comprised of the following questions:

  * Does this processing help further your interests?
  * Is processing this information a reasonable way of securing those interests?
  * Is there a less intrusive way to achieve the same result?

  The final part is the balancing test, which helps you decide whether the data subject’s interests override the legitimate interest. It’s comprised of the following questions:

  * What is the nature of your relationship with the data subject?
  * Is any of their personal data sensitive or private?
  * Would people expect you to use their data in this way?
  * Are you happy to explain it to them?
  * Are some people likely to object or find it intrusive?
  * What is the possible impact on the individual?
  * How big an impact might it have on them?
  * Are you processing children’s data?
  * Are any of the individuals vulnerable in any way?
  * Can you adopt safeguards to minimise the impact?
  * Are any of the individuals vulnerable in any way?
