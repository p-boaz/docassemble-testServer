  Register with Philippines National Privacy Commission
subquestion: |
  DPO Registration is the process by which a Personal Information Controller (PIC) or Personal Information Processor (PIP) provides the National Privacy Commission (NPC) with relevant information regarding its data protection officer.

  A PIC or PIP shall register if it is processing personal data and operating in the country under any of the following conditions:

  - the PIC or PIP employs at least two hundred fifty (250) employees;
  - the processing includes sensitive personal information of at least one thousand (1,000) individuals;
  - the processing is likely to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Processing operations that pose a risk to data subjects include those that involve:
    - Information that would likely affect national security, public safety, public order, or public health;
    - Information required by applicable laws or rules to be confidential;
    - Vulnerable data subjects like minors, the mentally ill, asylum seekers, the elderly, patients, those involving criminal offenses, or in any other case where an imbalance exists in the relationship between a data subject and a PIC or PIP;
    - Automated decision-making; or
    - Profiling;
  - the processing is not occasional and constitutes a core activity of a PIC or PIP, or is integral thereto. Data processing systems that involve automated decision-making shall, in all instances, be registered with the Commission. For all other data processing systems operating under the conditions set out in letter C and D, the Commission determined the specific sectors, industries, or entities that shall be covered by mandatory registration.
