question: |
  What you need to know about the GDPR
subquestion: |
  GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation.
  
  Itâ€™s a regulation designed to unify data protection laws across all member states of the European Union (EU), plus Ireland, Lichtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, and gives protected users and EU residents more rights and control over how their data is processed. 
  
  The GDPR applies to businesses that target EU data subjects.
  
  This means that the new privacy law is applicable not only to organizations operating within the EU, but also to those worldwide that target individuals in the EU.
  
  Any European citizen that has their data collected by a company is a data subject under the GDPR, and the company that processes their data is known as the data controller. If a third-party is employed to handle data processing (such as a payroll company), they are the data processor.
  
  Complying with this European regulation on data protection means ensuring data is collected legally, informing users of how it is treated, and keeping data secure (i.e., protected from breaches).
  
  Let's get started on the most basic questions to determine if you need to follow the GDPR and how you can become compliant.

  Since your company meets the GDPR's definition of targeting or monitoring EU citizens, the GDPR does apply. However, the extent of your obligations is determined by how many employees you have worldwide.

    More info
  content: |
    Paragraph 5 of GDPR Article 30 states that a company or organisation employing less than 250 persons may be exempt from maintaining records under Article 30. This exemption would only apply where processing is not likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects or not involving special categories of data subject or criminal data.
