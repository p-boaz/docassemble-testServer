question: |
  When do you need a DPIA?
subquestion: |
  A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify
  and minimize the data protection risks of a project.
  
  You must do a DPIA for processing that is **likely to result in a high risk**
  to individuals.
  
  To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the
  severity of any impact on individuals. A DPIA does not have to eradicate the
  risks altogether, but should help to minimise risks and assess whether or not
  remaining risks are justified. DPIAs are a legal requirement for processing
  that is likely to be high risk. But an effective DPIA can also bring broader
  compliance, financial and reputational benefits, helping you demonstrate
  accountability and building trust and engagement with individuals.
  
  As mentioned, a DPIA must be done before beginning any type of processing which
  is “likely to result in a high risk”. This means that although the actual level
  of risk has not been assessed, screening for factors that point to the
  potential for a widespread or serious impact on individuals must take place.
  
  Answer the following screening questions to determine your need for a DPIA.

question: |
  In general and according to European guidelines, a data controller processing activities that meet two of the listed factors below would require a DPIA. If multiple criteria are met by the processing it will more likely present a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, and would trigger the need for a DPIA.

auto terms:
  special categories: |
    This includes data that can be used to infer something about an individual, either on its own, or in combination with other data.
  systematic monitoring: |
    'systematic' means that the processing:
     
    * Occurs according to a system;
    * Is pre-arranged, organised or methodical;
    * Takes place as part of a general plan for data collection; or
    * Is carried out as part of a strategy.
  new technology/system: |
    * Innovative technology that involves new developments in technological knowledge in the world at large, rather than technology that is new to you. 
    * Using such technology can involve novel forms of data collection and use, possibly with a high risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. The personal and social consequences of deploying a new technology may be unknown.
    * In such cases, a DPIA can help the controller understand a control such risks.
  invisible processing: |
    * Controller processes personal data that it has not obtained directly from the data subject; and
    * Controller asserts that giving notice to data subjects would prove impossible or involve disproportionate effort. 
    * A DPIA is required where this processing is combined with any of the criteria from the European guidelines.
