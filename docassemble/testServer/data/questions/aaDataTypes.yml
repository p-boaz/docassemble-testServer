  What is a Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)?
content: |
  A completed ROPA lists each processing activity involving personal data and provides detailed information about each of the items listed above. While this may sound like a simple task, even building a complete list of processing activities is often a complex and time-consuming endeavor, involving detailed documentation reviews and multiple rounds of interviews with business users and IT. Larger organizations may want to create individual ROPAs for each department or line of business, and then roll up into a master enterprise-level record.

  Due to the high volume of their processing activities involving personal data, midsize-to-large companies will likely need a data discovery tool to begin pulling together and organizing the various elements of the ROPA. Smaller organizations may want to start with a spreadsheet containing one row per processing activity (e.g. “Candidate offer of employment”) and one column for each of the fields listed above.

question: |
  ${ users.familiar() }, you can do this!
subquestion: |  
  #### How this works
  
  You answer what you know. We do the rest. 
  
  A Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) is a record of an organization’s processing activities involving personal data. Some businesses may think of “processing” as being limited to active events, but a RoPA must also cover data that sits on a server or a shelf.

  A RoPA includes the following information for each processing activity:

  - Names and contact details of the data controller, data processor, data controller's representative, joint controller, and data protection officer (DPO), if applicable
  - Purpose (i.e., lawful basis) of processing personal data
  - Categories of data subjects and categories of personal data being processed
  - Categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed
  - Third parties in other countries or international organizations who receive the personal data
  - Retention schedule for each category of personal data
  - General description of technical and organizational security measures related to each processing activity

id: pre_DPIA
question: |
  When do you need a DPIA?
subquestion: |
  A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify
  and minimize the data protection risks of a project.
  
  You must do a DPIA for processing that is **likely to result in a high risk**
  to individuals.
  
  To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the
  severity of any impact on individuals. A DPIA does not have to eradicate the
  risks altogether, but should help to minimise risks and assess whether or not
  remaining risks are justified. DPIAs are a legal requirement for processing
  that is likely to be high risk. But an effective DPIA can also bring broader
  compliance, financial and reputational benefits, helping you demonstrate
  accountability and building trust and engagement with individuals.
  
  As mentioned, a DPIA must be done before beginning any type of processing which
  is “likely to result in a high risk”. This means that although the actual level
  of risk has not been assessed, screening for factors that point to the
  potential for a widespread or serious impact on individuals must take place.
  
  Answer the following screening questions to determine your need for a DPIA.

  special categories: |
    This includes data that can be used to infer something about an individual, either on its own, or in combination with other data.
  systematic monitoring: |
    'systematic' means that the processing:
     
    * Occurs according to a system;
    * Is pre-arranged, organised or methodical;
    * Takes place as part of a general plan for data collection; or
    * Is carried out as part of a strategy.
  new technology/system: |
    * Innovative technology that involves new developments in technological knowledge in the world at large, rather than technology that is new to you. 
    * Using such technology can involve novel forms of data collection and use, possibly with a high risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. The personal and social consequences of deploying a new technology may be unknown.
    * In such cases, a DPIA can help the controller understand a control such risks.
  invisible processing: |
    * Controller processes personal data that it has not obtained directly from the data subject; and
    * Controller asserts that giving notice to data subjects would prove impossible or involve disproportionate effort. 
    * A DPIA is required where this processing is combined with any of the criteria from the European guidelines.

  lawful basis: |
    #What is lawfulness?
    
    For processing of personal data to be lawful, you need to identify specific grounds for the processing. 
    This is called a **‘lawful basis’** for processing, and there are six options which depend on your purpose and your relationship with the individual.
    There are also specific additional conditions for processing some especially sensitive types of data.
