  What is a Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)?
content: |
  A completed ROPA lists each processing activity involving personal data and provides detailed information about each of the items listed above. While this may sound like a simple task, even building a complete list of processing activities is often a complex and time-consuming endeavor, involving detailed documentation reviews and multiple rounds of interviews with business users and IT. Larger organizations may want to create individual ROPAs for each department or line of business, and then roll up into a master enterprise-level record.

  Due to the high volume of their processing activities involving personal data, midsize-to-large companies will likely need a data discovery tool to begin pulling together and organizing the various elements of the ROPA. Smaller organizations may want to start with a spreadsheet containing one row per processing activity (e.g. “Candidate offer of employment”) and one column for each of the fields listed above.

  #### Here's how this works
  
  You answer what you know. We do the rest. 
  
  A Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) is a record of an organization’s processing activities involving personal data. Some businesses may think of “processing” as being limited to active events, but a RoPA must also cover data that sits on a server or a shelf.

  A RoPA includes the following information for each processing activity:

  - Names and contact details of the data controller, data processor, data controller's representative, joint controller, and data protection officer (DPO), if applicable
  - Purpose (i.e., lawful basis) of processing personal data
  - Categories of data subjects and categories of personal data being processed
  - Categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed
  - Third parties in other countries or international organizations who receive the personal data
  - Retention schedule for each category of personal data
  - General description of technical and organizational security measures related to each processing activity

  % endif
  
  % for index, row in data_types[category].df.iterrows():
  
    % if data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'legitimate interests':
  #### Legal Basis: `Legitimate Interests`
    
    The latest indications from data protection authorities suggest that they will start scrutinising the Legitimate Interests basis more. We suggest utilising a three-part test to ensure you are confident in claiming this legal basis. 
    
    * Take the test [here]
    [here]: ${ interview_url(i='docassemble.testServer:data/questions/legitimate_interests.yml') }
    
    % elif data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'public task':
  #### Legal Basis: `Public Task`
    
      Public task refers to the need to collect data in the public interest, such as during a task by a public authority.
      
      It usually doesn't apply to private companies, but it also doesn't require statutory power to process the data.
      
      Like other lawful bases, the processing must be necessary. You can't claim this basis if you can get away without processing the data.

    % elif data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'consent':
  #### Legal Basis: `Consent`
    
    Consent is perhaps the strongest of the lawful bases because it speaks to the mission of the GDPR: to put the data subject back in control of their own data.

    In essence, it requires you to ask the data subject for permission to process their data before you collect it. Consent can't be implied. You can't assume that they agree to your data processing just because they use your site.

    % elif data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'contract':
  #### Legal Basis: `Contract`
    
    The contractual basis exists to protect processors who require data to fulfill a contract.
    
    In most cases, the data you need to fulfill a contract comes from the basis of your legitimate interests. However, for data that doesn't apply to every customer or when you need to meet a contract that differs from the norm, you can add the contractual basis.

    % elif data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'legal obligation':
  #### Legal Basis: `Legal Obligation`
    
    The legal obligation basis states that you need to process personal data to comply with the law. For example, a bank may need to process passport numbers or Social Security numbers to meet federal standards for proof of identification as well as anti-money laundering statutes.
    
    However, if you run a social media platform, you don't require these sensitive pieces of data because there's no law saying so. As a result, you'd need to rely on a different basis.

     When you quote your legal obligation, it's a good idea to also state what statutes or agencies you report to.

    % elif data_types[category].details[index].legal_basis == 'vital interests':
  #### Legal Basis: `Vital Interests`
    
    The vital interests basis refers to processing that is absolutely necessary but also a case where consent won't apply.
    
    The given interpretation of the basis says that you rely on it if you need it to protect someone's life but you can't otherwise get consent for the processing (either they can't or won't provide it).
    
    Most businesses won't rely on vital interest at all. Healthcare organizations (namely emergency medical care providers) and public bodies may be the only ones who use this basis.

    % endif
  
  #### Risk assessment   
      
    A processing activity that meets two pre-DPIA factors requires a DPIA. If multiple criteria are met by the processing it will more likely present a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, and would trigger the need for a DPIA.
      
    % if len(data_types[category].details[index].dpia_factors.true_values()) >= 2:
    **You indicated you will meet at least two of the listed factors. Therefore, you should complete a full DPIA.**
    % else: 
    **You indicated you will meet less than two of the listed factors. Therefore, you do not need to complete a full DPIA.**
    % endif

  #### Controller/Processor obligations

    % if data_types[category].details[index].is_controller:
  As the controller of **${ data_types[category].details[index].name }** data you have additional obligations. 
  
    % elif data_types[category].details[index].is_controller is None:
  Find out how determine whether you're a controller or processor of **${ data_types[category].details[index].name }** data.
  
    % else:
    As the processor of **${ data_types[category].details[index].name }** data, you have fewer requirements.

      For processing of personal data to be lawful, you need to identify specific grounds for the processing. 
      This is called a **‘lawful basis’** for processing, and there are six options which depend on your purpose and your relationship with the individual.
      There are also specific additional conditions for processing some especially sensitive types of data.

id: pre_DPIA
question: |
  When do you need a DPIA?
subquestion: |
  A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify
  and minimize the data protection risks of a project.
  
  You must do a DPIA for processing that is **likely to result in a high risk**
  to individuals.
  
  To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the
  severity of any impact on individuals. A DPIA does not have to eradicate the
  risks altogether, but should help to minimise risks and assess whether or not
  remaining risks are justified. DPIAs are a legal requirement for processing
  that is likely to be high risk. But an effective DPIA can also bring broader
  compliance, financial and reputational benefits, helping you demonstrate
  accountability and building trust and engagement with individuals.
  
  As mentioned, a DPIA must be done before beginning any type of processing which is “likely to result in a high risk”. This means that although the actual level of risk has not been assessed, screening for factors that point to the potential for a widespread or serious impact on individuals must take place.
  
  Answer the following screening questions to determine your need for a DPIA.

    This includes data that can be used to infer something about an individual, either on its own, or in combination with other data.
  invisible processing: |
    * Controller processes personal data that it has not obtained directly from the data subject; and
    * Controller asserts that giving notice to data subjects would prove impossible or involve disproportionate effort. 
    * A DPIA is required where this processing is combined with any of the criteria from the European guidelines.
