  #What is lawfulness?
subquestion: |
  For processing of personal data to be lawful, you need to identify specific grounds for the processing. 
  
  This is called a **‘lawful basis’** for processing, and there are six options which depend on your purpose and your relationship with the individual.
  
  There are also specific additional conditions for processing some especially sensitive types of data.
